# Neural Network Training with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the basics of training a neural network. The notebook utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Contents

- `neural_network_training.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and explanations.
- `data/`: Directory containing any datasets used in the notebook.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Description

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the data using Pandas.
2. **Network Architecture**: Defining the neural network structure.
3. **Training**: Training the neural network using the prepared data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results using Matplotlib.

## Usage

To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially.

```bash
jupyter notebook Training_Basic_Neural_Network_training.ipynb
```
